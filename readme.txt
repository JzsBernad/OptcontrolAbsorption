To generate the plots in the paper, run the scripts fig10a_fig10b.jl, fig11.jl, fig12.jl and fig13a_fig13b.jl. Running the scripts might require additional packages, 
which can be installed via the julia package manager with the following code

using Pkg 
elem_list = ["Distributed", "LsqFit", "Formatting", "JLD", "LaTeXStrings", "Optimization", "Ipopt", "OptimizationOptimJL", "OptimizationOptimisers", "ForwardDiff", "Zygote", "BenchmarkTools", "QuadGK", "Roots", "SharedArrays", "Plots", "PGFPlotsX"]
for elem in elem_list
   Pkg.add(elem)
end

The .ipynb files (jupyter notebooks) contain additional tests and plots. The functions to calculate the results are scripts_photon_catching_full.jl and optimize_T_to_P_s.jl
The Results folder contains files with calculated results. The scripts for the figures call these to generate the plots, but if they are removed they will recalculate the data from scratch. Plots contains the figures generated by the scripts.
